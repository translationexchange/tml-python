TML library for Python is a set of classes that provide translation functionality for any Python based application.
The library uses Translation Markup Language that allows you to encode complex language structures in simple, yet powerful forms.

The library works in conjunctions with TranslationExchange.com service that provides machine and human translations for your application.
In order to use the library, you should sign up at TranslationExchange.com, create a new application and copy the application key and secret.


Django Integration
==================

If you are planning on using TML in a Django application, you should use tml-python-django package.

https://github.com/translationexchange/tml-python-django


Installation
==================

To install the package, use pip:

```ssh
pip install tml
```


Registering Your App
===================================

Before you can proceed with the integration, please register with http://translationexchange.com and create a new application.

At the end of the registration process you will be given a key and a secret. You will need to enter them in the initialization function of the TML SDK.



Usage
==================

The library can be invoked from the IRB. To use TML client you must require it, and instantiate the application with the key and secret of your app from translationexchange.com:

```python
>>> import tml
>>> ...
```

Now you can use the application to get any language registered with your app:

```python
>>> ...
```

Simple example:

```python
>>> ...
```

Using description context:

```python
>>> ...
```

Numeric rules with piped tokens:

```python
>>> ...
```

Gender rules:

```python
>>> ...

>>> ...
```

Gender rules with language cases:

```python
...
```

Decoration tokens:

```python
...
```

Nested decoration tokens:

```python
...
```

Data tokens with decoration tokens together:

```python
...
```

PS. The Russian translation on translationexchange.com could either be provided by a set of 6-9 simple translations for {genders}(male, female, unknown) * count{one, few, many} or by a single advanced translation
in the form of:

```python
...
```

Or in a simpler form:

```python
...
```

One of the advantages of using TML is the ability to easily switch token values. The above example in a text based email can reuse translations:

```python
...
```

You should also notice that all of the translation keys you've been using in your experiments will be registered under your application by the translationexchange.com service. You can view them all at:

https://dashboard.translationexchange.com/

If any translation key you've tried to translate was missing a translation, you can manually translate it using the service (with the help of a machine translation suggestion).

```python
...
```

Then without leaving your IRB session, you can call the following method to reset your application cache:

```python
...
```

Then you can just rerun the translation method with the missing translation and you should get back the translated value.

```python
...
```
